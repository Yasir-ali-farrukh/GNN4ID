<p align="justify">GNNifyID is a tool designed to transform raw packet capture files (PCAP) of network traffic into structured graph-based datasets. This tool uniquely integrates both flow and packet-level information, providing a comprehensive view of network activity. Developed to facilitate research in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), GNNifyID empowers users to seamlessly extract flow-level information along with its respective packet-level information, which is ultimately combined to form a graph-based dataset. The developed graph-based dataset utilizes both flow-level and packet-level information</p>
